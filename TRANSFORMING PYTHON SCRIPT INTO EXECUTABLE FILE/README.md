# TRANSFORMING PYTHON SCRIPT INTO EXECUTABLE FILE
Custom web scrapers are hard to use by the final clients who want to update by their own, the Excel or Google Sheets files with new data on a regularly basis. So instead of sending them the Python Script you can send them an executable file that can be double clicked whenever they need to scrape new data.
