In this project, I'll use gspread API to create something similar to a database in Google Sheets. This API allows our Python script to communicate with Google Sheets and allows automatic sheet updates when the script is run. In this case, we will have the URL column with links that need to be scrapped. When the scraper is run the sheets will automatically update with all the necessary data.
